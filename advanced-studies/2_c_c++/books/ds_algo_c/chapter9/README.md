## CHAPTER 9

### Review Questions 9.2

1. Reffering to Fig. 9.1, give a list of each of the following: (a) the ancestors of node U, (b) the children of node S, (c) the descendants of node S, (d) the parent of node V.
   a: answer: the ancestors of node U are T and R.
   b: answer: the children of node S is X.
   c: answer: the descendents of node S are X, Y, Z
   d: answer: the parent of node V is T.
2. How many nodes in a tree have no ancestors?
   answer: just the root has no ancestors
3. What is the name for a node in a tree that has no descendants?
   answer: the leaves of the tree are the nodes that have no children.
4. Given a particular node N in a tree, how many paths are there that connect the root node of the tree to node N?
   answer: it depends of how many ancestors the N has and how many descendants the Root has till the node N.

### 9.2 exercises

1. Count the number of edges, e, and the number of nodes, n, in the tree in Fig. 9.1.
   Draw some other trees, and count their nodes and edges. Is there a relationship
   that you notice between the number of nodes and the number of edges? Can you
   prove that this relationship is always true for any tree, T?
answer: A tree with ‘n’ vertices has ‘n-1’ edges. If it has one more edge extra than ‘n-1’, then the extra edge should obviously has to pair up with two vertices which leads to form a cycle. Then, it becomes a cyclic graph which is a violation for the tree graph.

2. Suppose each node in a tree T has either exactly two children or has no children.
   In other words, each node
   We full
   call
   such a tree a
   is
   either a leaf or
   binary
   of leaves and the number of
   holds true for any full
   tree.
   What
   is
   it
   has exactly two nonempty children.
   the relationship between the
   internal nodes in tree
   binary tree.

   answer: If T has L leaves, the number of internal nodes is I = L – 1. Basically, this theorem says that the number of nodes N, the number of leaves L, and the number of internal nodes I are related in such a way that if you know any one of them, you can determine the other two.
